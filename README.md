# Image_classification_AI
This project implements a complete deep learning pipeline for binary image classification using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV. It covers dataset preprocessing, model building, evaluation, visualization, and optimization with transfer learning.

**The workflow includes**:
**Data Preprocessing** â€” Loading dataset (via Keras), normalization, resizing, visualization.
**Custom CNN Model** â€” Implemented from scratch, trained on preprocessed images, evaluated with accuracy/loss curves.
**Data Augmentation** â€” Rotation, flipping, zoom, and shift transformations to improve generalization.
**Model Evaluation** â€” Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
**Transfer Learning** â€” Fine-tuning MobileNetV2 on the same dataset and comparing results with the custom CNN.
**Visualizations** â€” Loss/accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and sample predictions.

**ðŸš€ Features:**
1.End-to-end pipeline in a single notebook.
2.Clear performance comparison between custom CNN and MobileNetV2.
3.Visual results for easy interpretation.
4.Ready-to-run on Google Colab with GPU support.
