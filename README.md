# Image_classification_AI
This project demonstrates an image classification pipeline built in Google Colab using:

*Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

*Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2

The workflow includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison between the two approaches.


**The workflow includes**:

**Data Preprocessing** â€” Loading dataset (via Keras), normalization, resizing, visualization.

**Custom CNN Model** â€” Implemented from scratch, trained on preprocessed images, evaluated with accuracy/loss curves.

**Data Augmentation** â€” Rotation, flipping, zoom, and shift transformations to improve generalization.

**Model Evaluation** â€” Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.

**Transfer Learning** â€” Fine-tuning MobileNetV2 on the same dataset and comparing results with the custom CNN.

**Visualizations** â€” Loss/accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and sample predictions.



**ðŸš€ Features:**

1.End-to-end pipeline in a single notebook.

2.Clear performance comparison between custom CNN and MobileNetV2.

3.Visual results for easy interpretation.

4.Ready-to-run on Google Colab with GPU support.
